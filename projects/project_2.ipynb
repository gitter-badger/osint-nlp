Portions of this report may describe deficiencies or potential deficiencies in the systems,\\npolicies, procedures, practices, or conduct of the firm that is the subject of this report.\\nThe express inclusion of certain deficiencies and potential deficiencies, however, should\\nnot be construed to support any negative inference that any other aspect of the firm\\'s\\nsystems, policies, procedures, practices, or conduct is approved or condoned by the\\nBoard or judged by the Board to comply with laws, rules, and professional standards.\\n2. Any references in this report to violations or potential violations of law, rules, or\\nprofessional standards should be understood in the supervisory context in which this\\nreport was prepared. Any such references are not a result of an adversarial adjudicative\\nprocess and do not constitute conclusive findings of fact or of violations for purposes of\\nimposing legal liability. Similarly, any description herein of a firm\\'s cooperation in\\naddressing issues constructively should not be construed, and is not construed by the\\nBoard, as an admission, for purposes of potential legal liability, of any violation.\\n3. Board inspections encompass, among other things, whether the firm has failed to\\nidentify departures from Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (\"GAAP\") in its audits\\nof financial statements. This report\\'s descriptions of any such auditing failures\\nnecessarily involve descriptions of the related GAAP departures. The Board, however,\\nhas no authority to prescribe the form or content of an issuer\\'s financial statements.\\nThat authority, and the authority to make binding determinations concerning an issuer\\'s\\ncompliance with GAAP, rests with the Securities and Exchange Commission (\"SEC\" or\\n\"Commission\"). Any description, in this report, of perceived departures from GAAP\\nshould not be understood as an indication that the Commission has considered or made\\nany determination regarding these GAAP issues unless otherwise expressly stated.\\n\\n\\x0cPCAOB Release No. 104-2005-022\\n\\nINSPECTION OF TAMAS B. REVAI, CPA\\nThe Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (\"PCAOB\" or \"the Board\") has\\nconducted an inspection of the registered public accounting firm Tamas B. Revai, CPA\\n(\"the Firm\"). The Board is issuing this report of that inspection in accordance with the\\nrequirements of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (\"the Act\").\\nThe Board is making portions of the report publicly available. Specifically, the\\nBoard is releasing to the public Part I of the report and portions of Part IV of the report.\\nPart IV of the report consists of the Firm\\'s comments, if any, on a draft of the report.1/\\nThe Board has elsewhere described in detail its approach to making inspectionrelated information publicly available consistent with legal restrictions.2/ A substantial\\nportion of the Board\\'s criticisms of a firm (specifically criticisms of the firm\\'s quality\\ncontrol system), and the Board\\'s dialogue with the firm about those criticisms, occurs\\nout of public view, unless the firm fails to make progress to the Board\\'s satisfaction in\\naddressing those criticisms. In addition, the Board generally does not disclose\\notherwise nonpublic information, learned through inspections, about the firm or its\\nclients. Accordingly, information in those categories generally does not appear in the\\npublicly available portion of an inspection report.\\n\\n1/\\n\\nThe Board does not make public any of a firm\\'s comments that address a\\nnonpublic portion of the report. In addition, pursuant to section 104(f) of the Act, 15\\nU.S.C. ยง 7214(f), and PCAOB Rule 4007(b), if a firm requests, and the Board grants,\\nconfidential treatment for any of the firm\\'s comments on a draft report, the Board does\\nnot include those comments in the final report at all. The Board notes that it routinely\\ngrants confidential treatment, if requested, for any of a firm\\'s comments that identify\\nfactually inaccurate statements, in the draft, that the Board corrects in the final report.\\n2/\\n\\nSee Statement Concerning the Issuance of Inspection Reports, PCAOB\\nRelease No. 104-2004-001 (August 26, 2004).\\n\\n\\x0cPCAOB Release No. 104-2005-022\\nInspection of Tamas B. Revai, CPA\\nJune 23, 2005\\nPage 2\\n\\nPART I\\nINSPECTION PROCEDURES AND CERTAIN OBSERVATIONS\\nMembers of the Board\\'s inspection staff (\"the inspection team\") conducted\\nfieldwork for the inspection on September 7, 2004 and October 7, 2004. The fieldwork\\nincluded procedures tailored to the nature of the Firm, certain aspects of which the\\ninspection team understood at the outset of the inspection to be as follows:\\nNumber of offices\\n\\n1 (New York, New York)\\n\\nOwnership structure\\n\\nSole proprietorship\\n\\nNumber of partners\\n\\n1\\n\\nNumber of professional staff3/\\n\\nNone\\n\\nNumber of issuer audit clients4/\\n\\nNone5/\\n\\nBoard inspections are designed to identify and address weaknesses and\\ndeficiencies related to how a firm conducts audits. To achieve that goal, Board\\ninspections include reviews of certain aspects of selected audits performed by the firm\\nand reviews of other matters related to the firm\\'s quality control system.\\nIn the course of reviewing aspects of selected audits, an inspection may identify\\nways in which a particular audit is deficient, including failures by the firm to identify, or to\\n3/\\n\\n\"Professional staff\" includes all personnel of the Firm, except partners or\\nshareholders and administrative support personnel.\\n4/\\n\\nThe number of issuer audit clients shown here is based on the Firm\\'s selfreporting and the inspection team\\'s review of certain information for inspection planning\\npurposes. It does not reflect any Board determination concerning which, or how many,\\nof the Firm\\'s audit clients are \"issuers\" as defined in the Act.\\n5/\\n\\nPrior to the beginning of the inspection field work, the Firm ceased to be\\nthe auditor of its single issuer client. The inspection team reviewed aspects of the\\nFirm\\'s most recent complete audit of this former client.\\n\\n\\x0cPCAOB Release No. 104-2005-022\\nInspection of Tamas B.

Those\\ndeficiencies included โ\\n(1)\\nthe pervasive failure to plan, perform, and document performance of the\\naudit or the quarterly reviews of interim financial information for the first three\\nquarters of the issuer\\'s fiscal year; and\\n6/\\n\\nWhen it comes to the Board\\'s attention that an\\nstatements appear not to present fairly, in a material respect, the\\nresults of operations or cash flows of the issuer in conformity with\\nreports that information to the SEC, which has jurisdiction to\\naccounting in issuers\\' financial statements.\\n7/\\n\\nissuer\\'s financial\\nfinancial position,\\nGAAP, the Board\\ndetermine proper\\n\\nPCAOB standards require a firm to take appropriate actions to assess the\\nimportance of audit deficiencies identified after the date of the audit report to the firm\\'s\\npresent ability to support its previously expressed opinions. See AU 390, Consideration\\nof Omitted Procedures After the Report Date, and AU 561, Subsequent Discovery of\\nFacts Existing at the Date of the Auditor\\'s Report (both included among the PCAOB\\'s\\ninterim auditing standards, pursuant to PCAOB Rule 3200T). Failure to comply with\\nthese PCAOB standards could be a basis for Board disciplinary sanctions.\\n\\n\\x0cPCAOB Release No. 104-2005-022\\nInspection of Tamas B.

This review addressed practices, policies and\\nprocedures concerning audit performance, training, compliance with independence\\nstandards, client acceptance and retention, and the establishment of policies and\\nprocedures. As described above, any defects in, or criticisms of, the Firm\\'s quality\\ncontrol system are discussed in the nonpublic portion of this report and will remain\\nnonpublic unless the Firm fails to address them to the Board\\'s satisfaction within 12\\nmonths of the date of this report.\\nEND OF PART I\\n\\n\\x0cPCAOB Release No. 104-2005-022\\nInspection of Tamas B.

The Firm provided a written response.\\nPursuant to section 104(f) of the Act and PCAOB Rule 4007(b), if a firm requests,\\nand the Board grants, confidential treatment for any of the firm\\'s comments on a draft\\nreport, the Board does not include those comments in the final report.
